Since in most locations almost every possible product is priced within
a single day, we were not able to find any strong correlations between
product pricings using the apriori algorithm. However we still learned
a few facts about the data. One thing that stood out was that for
every city in Kenya, every day, wheat flour and long grain rice were
priced together in the same day.

/*
 * Query 1
 *
 * Explore the data in order to get “a feel of” the prices of the various products in a
 * country. The user should be able to drill down from 6 months, to one month, to a
 * specific day, and roll up again.
 */

/*
 * Query 2
 *
 * Explore the data in order to get “a feel of” the price differences of the products when
 * considering more than one country. For example, one may want to contrast the price
 * of tuna steaks in Kenya with that in India. The user should be able to drill down
 * from 6 months, to one month, to a specific day, and roll up again.
 */

/*
 * Query 3
 *
 * Explore the data by considering the prices of categories of products. That is, we wish

 * fresh meat.
 */

/*
 * Query 4
 *
 * Explore the data by considering the prices of categories of products, on a specific day

 */

/*
 * Query 7

 */

/*
 * Query 8
 *
 * Compare the prices of two complementary products (e.g. white rice and long-grain rice),
